# Asteroid Shooter :milky_way:

This repository contains the code of a basic :rocket:Asteroid shooter game created using [allegro][allegro] library.<br>
This code is written:black_nib: by a group of :trollface: friends who have started this in hope of learning something new and to get<br>
the experience of working in teams where everyone have a different :desktop_computer:working environment.

We hope to learn and use [Cmake][Cmake] in this repository so that this game could be easily installed on different<br>
platforms(We are talking only about windows and linux, we are beginners.) and behave similarly on different platforms.<br>
(Using Cmake seems too ambitious at the time of writing this..:joy::laughing:)

Upon completion of this project you could expect these links to get you a copy of the game for your platform:
